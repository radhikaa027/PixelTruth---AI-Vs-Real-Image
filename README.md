## Introduction

In today’s digital age, the line between authentic and synthetic visual content is increasingly blurred. PixelTruth addresses this challenge by providing a robust solution that differentiates real images from those generated by AI. The project is designed not only to aid in the detection of fabricated images but also to empower users to verify the authenticity of digital media with ease.

---

## Project Overview

PixelTruth is built on a deep learning framework utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed in TensorFlow and Keras. The system has been rigorously trained on a diverse dataset, and its performance is validated through comprehensive evaluation metrics. A user-friendly web interface, built using Streamlit, allows seamless image verification by uploading local files or specifying image URLs.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the **CIFAKE** dataset, which comprises:

- **Real Images:** 60,000 images sourced from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **AI-Generated Images:** 60,000 images generated using advanced AI techniques.

In addition, the dataset is enriched with:
- **Web-Scraped Images:** An extra 660 images (330 real and 330 AI-generated) collected via web scraping.
- **Celebrity Images:** A set of real images of Indian celebrities paired with their AI-generated counterparts produced using Leonardo.ai.

### How to Acquire the Dataset

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset:** Downloadable from the [official CIFAR-10 website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
- **CIFAKE Dataset:** Constructed by combining the CIFAR-10 images with AI-generated images. Detailed preprocessing steps are provided in the repository’s scripts.

---

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Dataset Reduction:** Due to hardware constraints, the original training and testing datasets were reduced (70% reduction in training and 90% in testing).
- **Image Resizing and Normalization:** All images are resized to 48x48 pixels and normalized to the range [0, 1] to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- **File Naming Standardization:** Spaces in image filenames are replaced with underscores to prevent file handling issues during processing.

### Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed using Keras with the following key components:

- **Input Layer:** Accepts images of shape (48, 48, 3).
- **Convolutional Layers:** Four layers with filters (32, 64, 128, 256) using ReLU activation to extract hierarchical features.
- **MaxPooling Layers:** Reduce spatial dimensions after each convolution to lower computational complexity.
- **Dropout Layers:** Applied after pooling to reduce overfitting.
- **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers culminate in a binary output (real vs. AI-generated) using a sigmoid activation.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **Training:** The model is trained for 15 epochs using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
- **Evaluation:** Achieves high performance with approximately 93% training accuracy and around 92.7% validation accuracy. Precision, recall, and F1-score are all consistently high, ensuring balanced classification performance.

---

## Implementation

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** For building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing (resizing, normalization, etc.).
- **Streamlit:** For deploying a user-friendly web interface.
- **Other Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.

### Code Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to reduce dataset size, standardize filenames, and prepare images.
- **Model Training:** Notebooks and Python scripts that define the CNN architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
- **Deployment:** A Streamlit application that allows users to interact with the model by uploading images or providing URLs.

---

## Deployment

PixelTruth is deployed via a Streamlit web application. Users can:
- **Upload an image file:** Directly from their computer.
- **Provide an image URL:** For remote images.

The application processes the image, predicts its authenticity, and displays the result along with the image preview. The deployment code handles various image formats and edge cases to ensure a smooth user experience.

---

## Results

The trained model demonstrates robust performance:
- **Accuracy:** ~93% on training data and ~92.7% on validation data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** High precision, recall, and F1-scores indicate balanced and reliable classification.
- **Training Trends:** Both loss and accuracy metrics show steady improvement over the epochs, validating the model’s learning and generalization capabilities.

---

## Future Work

Future enhancements for PixelTruth include:
- Extending the model to support other media types (videos, audio, text).
- Incorporating advanced techniques such as transfer learning, ensemble methods, and adversarial training to further improve model robustness.
- Adding explainability modules to help users understand model decisions.
- Exploring collaborative initiatives with industry and academia for continuous improvement and dataset expansion.
